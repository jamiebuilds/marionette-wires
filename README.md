Marionette Starter Kit
======================

A nice starter kit for Marionette.js apps.

## Quick start

[Clone](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) or [download](https://github.com/thejameskyle/marionette-starter-kit/archive/master.zip) this repo.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:thejameskyle/marionette-starter-kit.git && cd marionette-starter-kit
```

Make sure [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) are
[installed](http://nodejs.org/download/).

```sh
npm install && npm start
```

Once that's done, open up http://localhost:9000/ in your browser.

## Guide

There are additional `README.md` files all throughout the application. However, the documentation is a work in progress.

As a general rule, be sure to read through all of the source code yourself and make sure you understand what is happening.
